A NOTE FROM CASA24
==============================================================================

Please respect the spirit of this work. This repository was built with care to 
support the music-making community. We're sharing our production code because 
we believe in open creativity, not closed gardens.

If you'd like to build on it, that's wonderful! Just do so in your own copy.
Think of this repository as a master recordingâ€”you can sample it, remix it, 
and create something new, but you can't change the original master.

Thank you for understanding and respecting these boundaries. By doing so, 
you help ensure this resource remains stable and available for everyone.
